-- First, let's see all the survey categories in your data
-- Run this to see what categories exist:

-- This would show all unique survey categories if we had the data in the database
-- For now, based on the CSV structure, here are the categories I can identify:

-- Multi-entry categories (need room details):
-- - Classrooms
-- - Specialized Classrooms  
-- - Special Education Classrooms

-- Regular survey categories (single assessment per category):
-- - Cafeteria
-- - Kitchen
-- - Gymnasium
-- - Library/Media Center
-- - Auditorium
-- - Main Office
-- - Nurse's Office
-- - Counselor's Office
-- - Principal's Office
-- - Teacher Workroom/Lounge
-- - Storage Areas
-- - Restrooms
-- - Hallways/Corridors
-- - Stairwells
-- - Exterior Areas
-- - Parking Areas
-- - Playground/Outdoor Recreation
-- - Building Entrance/Exit
-- - HVAC/Mechanical Rooms
-- - Custodial Areas

-- The current database structure is actually correct and flexible enough
-- to handle ALL survey categories because:

-- 1. survey_responses table stores ALL regular survey responses regardless of category
-- 2. classroom_entries + classroom_responses tables handle the 3 multi-entry categories
-- 3. The survey_category field distinguishes between different types

-- Let's verify this with a query to show how data would be organized:
